Hello there 👋

- ⚖️ Lawyer turned software engineer👨🏻‍💻. The opportunity to creatively solve challenging problems while continuously improving my approach makes me passionate about software engineering.
- Pronouns: he/him/his
- 📚 🚧 ![ts](https://badgen.net/badge/-/TypeScript?icon=typescript&label&labelColor=blue&color=555555)
I'm currently building a [web application](https://github.com/3campos/rw-trackside-home-row-seats/) using Typescript and GraphQL using the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) framework, a Jamstack architecture that will fully support React server components and server-side rendering in future updates. The application is still being built, so, there is no live version available yet.
-  Fun facts: 
  - 🐶 I have a puppy named Wanda (yes, named after Wanda Maximoff).
  - 🗡 I participate in Japanese swordsmanship ("iaido"), play video games 🎮, and watch Formula 1 racing 🏎️ in my spare time.
